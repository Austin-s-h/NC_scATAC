## Part 0: Project Description

We will try to stick to Seurat-based objects as much as possible, which have provided the most flexibility and integrations. Recent updates to Seurat have also increased interoperability with Monocle3 and other tools. 

There are a total of 3 10X sequencing runs that we have performed.
Each of them have been summarized using the cellranger-atac pipeline into their respective timepoints.

## Part 1: Recalling peaks with MACS3

Because 10X called peaks are sometimes very large and in order to increase sensitivity to rare peaks, we call peaks using MACS3 for every cluster within every timepoint.

## Part 2: Harmonized Seurat, Dimensionality reduction.

We define a master consensus of peaks by combining the peak sets per timepoint. Next, we re-quantify libraries at these locations using fragment files, and create a harmonized
