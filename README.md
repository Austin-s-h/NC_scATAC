# Neural Crest scATAC-Seq Time Course Analysis

This repository aims to be a collection of useful guides and scripts for the analysis of single-cell ATAC-Seq datasets. Uniquely, it is based in chicken, which presents some unique configurations.

## Access

To create a copy of this repository for use with your own datasets, I recommend cloning the repository to a local folder. Next, modify the inputs to match your own. Alternatively, you can browse the .Rmd files on Github directly, and grab snippets of code you are interested in. There are a variety of new functions implemented by this analysis, which can be found in the 'Scripts' folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Austin-s-h/xxxx
```

## Usage

```R
# Correlation Analysis

source("./Scripts/Correlation.R")
...
```

## Contributing
I would love to grow this repository with input from others working on single-cell time course data. If you wish to contribute code, please open a Github issue or create a pull request.
